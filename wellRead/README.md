## Synopsis

WellRead allows users to sign in, and then they can search for a book. Once they find the desired book they can choose to go to the conversations side, find and create a conversation. When they take part in a conversation it will display only their username and time of comment. We enabled emoji's for comments to make it a 2017 conversation. Alternatively users can choose to add a book to their library. On a personal page of the book a user can write their own review, give it a rating, or use the digital bookmark. Users can also record if the book has been loaned out to a friend. Users can even take a picture of the book and highlight a passage, as a "Quote". If users choose to see their library there is both a scrolling piled books, and a display page of image tiles for each book. On the library page users can also click into their borrowed library and keep track of who they borrowed a book from. The personal rating is then averaged with all other ratings onto the conversation display page.
We are both very proud of the work and accomplishment of WellRead.  Hopefully you will find it useful too.

## Code 

WellRead uses the Amazon API to provide book details. An issue arose figuring out how to have multiple versions of the same book lead into the same pool of conversations.
We resolved this by having every specific edition also belong to a book. A book consisting only of Author and Title, being a basket of editions. This allowed the conversations to exist on the book instead of the specific edition.

## Motivation

We wanted an app that would let us keep all our own memories about a book.
We wanted users to be able to participate in conversations with each other.
